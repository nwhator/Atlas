# Atlas - Search Engine for CSS 522 Project

Welcome to the README file for the Atlas project - Information Retrieval Systems. In this project, we are building a search engine called Atlas using Python. The search engine will consist of several components, including a web crawler, indexer, query processor, ranking algorithm, and user interface.

## Project Overview

The main goal of Atlas is to develop a search engine that can retrieve relevant information from a given set of web pages. The search engine will follow the standard information retrieval process, which involves crawling the web, indexing the crawled pages, processing user queries, ranking the search results, and presenting them to the user through a user interface.

## Components

1. Web Crawler: The web crawler will be responsible for traversing the web and collecting web pages. It will follow links, download the HTML content of the pages, and store them for further processing.

2. Indexer: The indexer will process the downloaded web pages and create an index of the terms present in each page. This index will be used for efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on user queries.

3. Query Processor: The query processor will take user queries as input and process them to retrieve relevant documents from the index. It will use techniques like tokenization, stemming, and ranking to improve the accuracy of the search results.

4. Ranking Algorithm: The ranking algorithm will assign a relevance score to each document based on various factors like term frequency, document popularity, and user feedback. This score will be used to rank the search results and present the most relevant documents to the user.

5. User Interface: The user interface will provide a user-friendly way for users to interact with the search engine. It will allow users to enter queries, view search results, and navigate through the retrieved documents.

## Getting Started

To get started with Atlas, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries.
3. Run the web crawler to collect web pages.
4. Process the downloaded pages using the indexer.
5. Implement the query processor and ranking algorithm.
6. Develop the user interface to interact with the search engine.
7. Test the search engine with sample queries and evaluate the results.
